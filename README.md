# Welcome to my React Calculator

## This is part of the frontend project for my certificate on [links](https://www.freecodecamp.org)

this is a simple project you only need to clone the project
cd the folder
after that npm install
and then npm run dev and you should see the project running

I have done a calculator in the past with vanilla javascript, and i remember that tmaking that calculator was a challenge, and this one for sure it was more dificult thant the other freecodecamp projects, doing the logic with the validation was the real deal and it took me more than what I expected

I would say this is a good project
